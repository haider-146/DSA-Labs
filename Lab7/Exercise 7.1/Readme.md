# 🚀 Doubly Linked List for Long Integer Operations

This C++ program implements a **Doubly Linked List** to store and manipulate long integers. It supports:

✅ Storing long integers as a linked list.
✅ Displaying the stored number.
✅ Performing addition of two long integers.

---

## 🎯 Features
- 🔗 Uses a **doubly linked list** to handle large numbers.
- ➕ Supports **arithmetic operations** (currently addition, extendable).
- ➖ Handles **negative numbers**.

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started
### 📌 Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

### 🛠 Compilation & Execution
```sh
 g++ long_integer.cpp -o long_integer
 ./long_integer
```

---

## 📝 Usage
1. ▶️ Run the program.
2. ⌨️ Enter two long integers.
3. 📌 View their sum as output.

### 🔍 Example
```
Enter first long integer: 98765432109876543210
Enter second long integer: 12345678901234567890
First Long Integer: 98765432109876543210
Second Long Integer: 12345678901234567890
Sum: 111111111011111111100
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- ➖ **Subtraction**
- ✖️ **Multiplication**
- ➗ **Division**
- 📂 **File input/output support**
- ⚡ **Optimized memory management**
