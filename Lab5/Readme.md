# 🏆 Introduction to Priority Queue

A **Priority Queue** is a special type of queue where elements are dequeued based on priority rather than the order they were enqueued.

## 🔹 Key Features:
- Elements with **higher priority** are removed first.
- If multiple elements have the same priority, they follow **FIFO** (First In, First Out) order.
- Commonly used in **scheduling algorithms**, **Dijkstra's shortest path**, and **task management**.

## 📌 Example Usage:

## 🔧 Applications:
✔️ CPU scheduling  
✔️ Pathfinding algorithms  
✔️ Data compression (Huffman coding)
